## üî≠ Projects

- **[Lampung Script Recognition](https://github.com/muharismrgn/Klasifikasi-Aksara-Lampung/):** The Lampung Script Recognition project was designed to preserve the cultural heritage of the indigenous Lampung script of Indonesia through advanced machine learning. By employing transfer learning techniques with pretrained models, the project significantly improved the recognition and classification of the script across various styles. The approach was validated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with results indicating substantial improvements in script recognition, facilitating cultural preservation efforts.

- **[Olist E-Commerce Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/muharismrgn/Olist-E-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation):** This project focuses on optimizing marketing budget allocation and customer acquisition in the competitive e-commerce sector. By employing RFM analysis, it segments customers according to their shopping behaviors, enabling more precise marketing strategies, increasing sales, and fostering loyalty with a data-driven and machine learning approach.

- **[Bike Sharing Demand Prediction](https://github.com/muharismrgn/Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction):** Aimed at enhancing bike-sharing operations, this project predicts rental demand considering various factors such as weather, day, and time. Utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically regression, the model is trained on historical data. The Catboost Regressor model is optimized to achieve a minimal MAE and a high R2 score, demonstrating its effectiveness in forecasting demand. To make the solution accessible and interactive, the model is deployed using **[Streamlit](https://bikesharingprediction.streamlit.app/)**, allowing users to input variables and receive real-time rental demand predictions through a user-friendly web interface.

- **[NYC Taxi Trip Data Analysis](https://github.com/muharismrgn/NYC-Taxi-Trip-Data-Analysis ):** This project is centered on maximizing taxi service profitability by optimizing fleet distribution, meeting customer preferences, and identifying revenue opportunities. Through the analysis of demand patterns, revenue variations, and customer satisfaction drivers, it aims to enhance overall profitability and operational efficiency. The insights derived from the data are presented through interactive visualizations using **[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/muhamad.aris.margono/viz/Tableu_16983946550400/NYCTaxiTrip?publish=yes)**, enabling clearer interpretation and data-driven decision-making.

- **[Hospital Management System](https://github.com/muharismrgn/Hospital-Management-System ):** Developed in response to the data management and scheduling challenges in hospitals, this Python-based CRUD system improves communication and coordination among patients, doctors, and staff. It addresses common issues such as queueing problems, scheduling conflicts, and misinformation.

- **[Fire Forest Detection](https://bit.ly/deteksi-kebakaran-hutan):** This research explores fire detection strategies for forest fire management using digital imagery. Employing SVM classification and segmentation techniques, it achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, demonstrating effective fire location identification through IoU evaluation measures.
