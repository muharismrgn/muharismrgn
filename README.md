## üî≠ Projects

- **[Olist E-Commerce Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/muharismrgn/Olist-E-Commerce-Customer-Segmentation):** This project focuses on optimizing marketing budget allocation and customer acquisition in the competitive e-commerce sector. By employing RFM analysis, it segments customers according to their shopping behaviors, enabling more precise marketing strategies, increasing sales, and fostering loyalty with a data-driven and machine learning approach.

- **[Bike Sharing Demand Prediction](https://github.com/muharismrgn/Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction):** Aimed at enhancing bike-sharing operations, this project predicts rental demand considering various factors such as weather, day, and time. Utilizing machine learning techniques, specifically regression, the model is trained on historical data. The Catboost Regressor model is optimized to achieve a minimal MAE and a high R2 score, demonstrating its effectiveness in forecasting demand.

- **[NYC Taxi Trip Data Analysis](https://github.com/muharismrgn/NYC-Taxi-Trip-Data-Analysis ):** This project is centered on maximizing taxi service profitability by optimizing fleet distribution, meeting customer preferences, and identifying revenue opportunities. Through the analysis of demand patterns, revenue variations, and customer satisfaction drivers, it aims to enhance overall profitability and operational efficiency.

- **[Hospital Management System](https://github.com/muharismrgn/Hospital-Management-System ):** Developed in response to the data management and scheduling challenges in hospitals, this Python-based CRUD system improves communication and coordination among patients, doctors, and staff. It addresses common issues such as queueing problems, scheduling conflicts, and misinformation.

- **[Lampung Script Recognition]():** This study leverages transfer learning with pre-trained models for recognizing Lampung script, contributing to cultural preservation. It involves preprocessing, classification, and feature extraction using pre-trained models, with a focus on improving recognition accuracy through various performance metrics.

- **[Fire Forest Detection](https://bit.ly/deteksi-kebakaran-hutan):** This research explores fire detection strategies for forest fire management using digital imagery. Employing SVM classification and segmentation techniques, it achieves high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, demonstrating effective fire location identification through IoU evaluation measures.
